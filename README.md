Software Engineering: Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the design, development, maintenance, and operation of software systems. It encompasses a range of methodologies, processes, and tools aimed at improving software quality, productivity, and maintainability.
Traditional Programming: Traditional programming involves writing code to create software. It focuses primarily on coding and immediate problem-solving without necessarily following a structured process or considering long-term maintenance and scalability.
Differences:
●	Scope: Software engineering includes requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance, whereas traditional programming focuses on coding.
●	Process: Software engineering uses formal methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall), while traditional programming may not follow any formal process.
●	Team Dynamics: Software engineering often involves large teams and collaboration, whereas traditional programming can be done individually or by small teams.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process followed by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy high-quality software efficiently. It consists of several phases, each with its own set of activities and goal

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

1.	Planning:
○	Define the project's scope and objectives.
○	Identify resources, timelines, and risks.
○	Outcome: Project plan.
2.	Requirements Analysis:
○	Gather and document user and system requirements.
○	Outcome: Requirements specification.
3.	Design:
○	Create architectural and detailed designs for the software.
○	Outcome: Design documents.
4.	Implementation (Coding):
○	Translate design into executable code.
○	Outcome: Source code.
5.	Testing:
○	Verify that the software meets requirements and is free of defects.
○	Outcome: Tested software.
6.	Deployment:
○	Release the software to users.
○	Outcome: Operational software.
7.	Maintenance:
○	Perform ongoing support and updates.
○	Outcome: Updated software.


Agile vs waterfalls modells:

Waterfall Model:
The Waterfall model is a traditional sequential software development methodology. It follows a linear and rigid approach, where progress flows downwards through phases resembling a waterfall. 
Agile Methodology:
Agile is a modern iterative and incremental approach to software development. It focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and delivering value to customers early and continuously.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile Model:
●	Flexibility: Agile is iterative and allows for changes throughout the development process.
●	Collaboration: Emphasizes collaboration and customer feedback.
●	Deliverables: Produces work in small, consumable increments.
Waterfall Model:
●	Sequential: Follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
●	Documentation: Emphasizes thorough documentation.
●	Predictability: Works well when requirements are well-understood and stable.
Key Differences:
●	Change Management: Agile adapts to changes easily, while Waterfall is rigid.
●	User Involvement: Agile involves continuous user feedback; Waterfall involves users primarily at the beginning and end.
●	Project Type: Agile is suited for projects with evolving requirements, whereas Waterfall is better for projects with well-defined requirements.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements Engineering: The process of defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. It involves the following steps:
1.	Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders.
2.	Analysis: Refining and analyzing requirements.
3.	Specification: Documenting requirements in a clear, detailed manner.
4.	Validation: Ensuring requirements meet stakeholder needs.
5.	Management: Handling changes to requirements over time.
Importance: Requirements engineering is crucial because it ensures that the final software product meets user needs and expectations, thereby reducing the risk of project failure.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity: The design principle of dividing a software system into discrete, independent modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately.
Benefits:
●	Maintainability: Easier to fix and update specific parts of the software.
●	Scalability: New features can be added with minimal impact on existing modules.
●	Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

1.	Unit Testing:
○	Tests individual components or functions.
○	Ensures that each unit works correctly.
2.	Integration Testing:
○	Tests interactions between integrated units.
○	Ensures that combined units work together as expected.
3.	System Testing:
○	Tests the complete integrated system.
○	Ensures the system meets functional and non-functional requirements.
4.	Acceptance Testing:
○	Tests the system against user requirements.
○	Ensures the system is ready for delivery.
Importance of Testing: Testing is crucial to identify and fix defects, ensure software quality, and verify that the software meets user requirements.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version Control Systems (VCS): Tools that help manage changes to source code over time. They track revisions, allowing developers to collaborate and revert to previous versions if needed.
Examples:
●	Git: Distributed VCS, supports branching and merging, widely used with platforms like GitHub.
●	Subversion (SVN): Centralized VCS, maintains a single repository.
Importance: VCS are essential for collaborative development, maintaining history, and managing changes effectively.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Software Project Manager: Responsible for planning, executing, and closing software projects. Key responsibilities include:
●	Planning: Defining project scope, goals, and deliverables.
●	Scheduling: Creating timelines and milestones.
●	Resource Management: Allocating resources and managing the project team.
●	Risk Management: Identifying and mitigating risks.
●	Communication: Ensuring effective communication among stakeholders.

Challenges:
●	Scope Creep: Managing changes in project scope.
●	Time Management: Meeting deadlines.
●	Resource Constraints: Balancing limited resources

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software Maintenance: The process of modifying and updating software after its initial deployment. Types include:
1.	Corrective Maintenance: Fixing bugs and defects.
2.	Adaptive Maintenance: Updating software to work in new environments.
3.	Perfective Maintenance: Enhancing functionality and performance.
